After downloading the PDFs, run Split_pdf.ipynb to split each document into smaller sections.
Next, based on your keywords, use the split PDFs to run main-PDF-Youngsmodulus.ipynb and main-PDF-Swellingratio.ipynb for automated data extraction.

Once the Data_Extraction step is completed, use Table_Generation.ipynb to generate the final output CSV files.
